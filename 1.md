Here are some questions about stochastic process, please answer step by step.
### Problem Statement

A certain calculating machine uses only the digits 0 and 1. It is supposed to transmit one of these digits through several stages. However, at every stage, there is a probability \( p \) that the digit that enters this stage will be changed when it leaves and a probability \( q = 1 - p \) that it won’t. 

1. **Form a Markov chain** to represent the process of transmission by taking as states the digits 0 and 1. What is the matrix of transition probabilities?
2. **Draw a tree** and assign probabilities assuming that the process begins in state 0 and moves through two stages of transmission. What is the probability that the machine, after two stages, produces the digit 0 (i.e., the correct digit)?


### Answer to Problem 1

**Forming the Markov Chain and Finding the Transition Matrix**

We are given a process where a digit (0 or 1) is transmitted through several stages, and at each stage:

- The digit has a probability \( p \) of being **changed** (from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0).
- The digit has a probability \( q = 1 - p \) of **remaining the same**.

**States of the Markov Chain:**

- We define the states of the Markov chain as the digits themselves:
  - State 0: The digit is 0.
  - State 1: The digit is 1.

**Transition Probabilities:**

- **From State 0:**
  - To **State 0**: The digit remains 0 with probability \( q \).
  - To **State 1**: The digit changes from 0 to 1 with probability \( p \).

- **From State 1:**
  - To **State 1**: The digit remains 1 with probability \( q \).
  - To **State 0**: The digit changes from 1 to 0 with probability \( p \).

**Transition Probability Matrix:**

Let \( P \) be the transition matrix, where \( P_{ij} \) represents the probability of transitioning from state \( i \) to state \( j \):

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
P_{00} & P_{01} \\
P_{10} & P_{11}
\end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix}
\text{Probability from 0 to 0} & \text{Probability from 0 to 1} \\
\text{Probability from 1 to 0} & \text{Probability from 1 to 1}
\end{bmatrix}
= \begin{bmatrix}
q & p \\
p & q
\end{bmatrix}
\]

**Final Answer for Problem 1:**

The transition probability matrix is:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
q & p \\
p & q
\end{bmatrix}
\]

### Answer to Problem 2

**Drawing the Tree and Calculating the Probability**

**Starting Point:**

- The process begins in **State 0** (the digit 0).

**First Stage Transitions:**

From **State 0**, two possible transitions occur:

1. **Stay in State 0**:
   - Probability: \( q \)
   - Outcome: The digit remains 0.

2. **Transition to State 1**:
   - Probability: \( p \)
   - Outcome: The digit changes to 1.

**Second Stage Transitions:**

For each state reached after the first stage, we consider the possible transitions in the second stage.

- **From State 0 (after first stage):**

  1. **Stay in State 0**:
     - Probability: \( q \)
     - Outcome: The digit remains 0.
  
  2. **Transition to State 1**:
     - Probability: \( p \)
     - Outcome: The digit changes to 1.

- **From State 1 (after first stage):**

  1. **Transition to State 0**:
     - Probability: \( p \)
     - Outcome: The digit changes back to 0.
  
  2. **Stay in State 1**:
     - Probability: \( q \)
     - Outcome: The digit remains 1.

**Tree Diagram:**

Here's the conceptual tree diagram with assigned probabilities:

```
Start at State 0

First Stage:
- Remain in State 0 (probability q)
    Second Stage:
    - Remain in State 0 (probability q)
    - Transition to State 1 (probability p)
- Transition to State 1 (probability p)
    Second Stage:
    - Transition to State 0 (probability p)
    - Remain in State 1 (probability q)
```

**Calculating the Probabilities of Ending in State 0:**

We are interested in the paths that **end in State 0 after two stages**.

1. **Path 1**: State 0 → State 0 → State 0
   - Probability: \( q \times q = q^2 \)

2. **Path 2**: State 0 → State 1 → State 0
   - Probability: \( p \times p = p^2 \)

**Total Probability of Ending in State 0:**

\[
\text{Total Probability} = q^2 + p^2
\]

**Final Answer for Problem 2:**

The probability that the machine, after two stages, produces the digit 0 is:

\[
q^2 + p^2
\]

---

**Summary:**

1. The transition matrix for the Markov chain is:

   \[
   P = \begin{bmatrix}
   q & p \\
   p & q
   \end{bmatrix}
   \]

2. The probability that the machine produces the digit 0 after two stages, starting from digit 0, is:

   \[
   q^2 + p^2
   \]

### Problem Statement

Assume that a man’s profession can be classified as **professional**, **skilled labourer**, or **unskilled labourer**. Assume that, of the sons of professional men, 80 percent are professional, 10 percent are skilled labourers, and 10 percent are unskilled labourers. In the case of sons of skilled labourers, 60 percent are skilled labourers, 20 percent are professional, and 20 percent 
To solve this problem, we'll proceed step by step.

### **1. Set up the matrix of transition probabilities.**

We have three states representing professions:

- **State 1**: Professional (P)
- **State 2**: Skilled Labourer (S)
- **State 3**: Unskilled Labourer (U)

From the given information, we can construct the transition matrix \( P \), where \( P_{ij} \) represents the probability that a son is in state \( j \) given that his father is in state \( i \).

**Transition probabilities:**

- **Given the father is Professional (State 1):**
  - \( P_{1,1} = 0.80 \) (Professional to Professional)
  - \( P_{1,2} = 0.10 \) (Professional to Skilled Labourer)
  - \( P_{1,3} = 0.10 \) (Professional to Unskilled Labourer)

- **Given the father is Skilled Labourer (State 2):**
  - \( P_{2,1} = 0.20 \) (Skilled Labourer to Professional)
  - \( P_{2,2} = 0.60 \) (Skilled Labourer to Skilled Labourer)
  - \( P_{2,3} = 0.20 \) (Skilled Labourer to Unskilled Labourer)

- **Given the father is Unskilled Labourer (State 3):**
  - \( P_{3,1} = 0.25 \) (Unskilled Labourer to Professional)
  - \( P_{3,2} = 0.25 \) (Unskilled Labourer to Skilled Labourer)
  - \( P_{3,3} = 0.50 \) (Unskilled Labourer to Unskilled Labourer)

**Transition Matrix \( P \):**

\[
P = \begin{pmatrix}
0.80 & 0.10 & 0.10 \\
0.20 & 0.60 & 0.20 \\
0.25 & 0.25 & 0.50 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\]

### **2. Find the probability that a randomly chosen grandson of an unskilled labourer is a professional man.**

We are asked to find the probability that, starting from an unskilled labourer (State 3), his **grandson** (two generations later) is a professional (State 1).

To find the 2-step transition probability \( P^{(2)}_{3,1} \), we compute the matrix \( P \) squared and look at the entry in the 3rd row and 1st column. However, since we only need \( P^{(2)}_{3,1} \), we can compute it directly using the formula:

\[
P^{(2)}_{3,1} = \sum_{k=1}^{3} P_{3,k} \times P_{k,1}
\]

**Calculations:**

1. **First term (\( k=1 \)):**
   \[
   P_{3,1} \times P_{1,1} = 0.25 \times 0.80 = 0.20
   \]
   
2. **Second term (\( k=2 \)):**
   \[
   P_{3,2} \times P_{2,1} = 0.25 \times 0.20 = 0.05
   \]
   
3. **Third term (\( k=3 \)):**
   \[
   P_{3,3} \times P_{3,1} = 0.50 \times 0.25 = 0.125
   \]
   
4. **Sum of the terms:**
   \[
   P^{(2)}_{3,1} = 0.20 + 0.05 + 0.125 = 0.375
   \]

**Answer:**

The probability that a randomly chosen grandson of an unskilled labourer is a professional man is **0.375** or **37.5%**.

---

**Final Answer:**

1. The transition matrix is
\[
P = \begin{pmatrix}
0.80 & 0.10 & 0.10 \\
0.20 & 0.60 & 0.20 \\
0.25 & 0.25 & 0.50 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\]

2. The probability that a grandson of an unskilled labourer is a professional is **0.375**.
